# MorphieCore Agent Instructions

These rules apply repository-wide. More specific guidance may narrow, not weaken, authorization, security or change-control boundaries.

## Scope and Authorization

- Work against current goals, contracts and source. [Archived code](docs/archive.md) is reference only, not a parity requirement. Mainline status does not prove production readiness.
- Before editing, inspect branch, Git status and target diff. Preserve existing work; stop on overlapping external edits. Do not discard, stage, commit or push without scoped authorization; committing does not authorize pushing.
- Review and planning are read-only unless implementation is also requested. Authorized edits continue through disposable verification; stop for material unresolved choices, not arbitrary phase gates.
- Deployment/service changes, publication, credential operations and live/paid calls require explicit target/effect authorization and platform approval. Plans, credentials and prior successful calls are not authorization.

## Read the Relevant Context

Read [README](README.md) and [docs index](docs/README.md) before non-trivial work, then follow the owning sources rather than reading every guide:

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| Purpose, semantic concepts, standard APIs and Agent reuse | [Semantic Model](docs/architecture-v2/semantic-ir.md) and relevant [ADRs](docs/architecture-v2/README.md#架构决策) |
| Priorities / approved behavior slice | [next-goal](docs/implementation-plans/next-goal.md) / [current-focus](docs/implementation-plans/current-focus.md) |
| Mapping, loss and fidelity | [Protocol/lowering](docs/architecture-v2/protocol-and-lowering.md), affected profiles, codecs and callers |
| Ownership, I/O and failure boundaries | [Architecture](docs/architecture.md), [execution](docs/architecture-v2/execution-model.md) |
| Gaps and verification | [Implementation gaps](docs/implementation-status/generation.md), [development](docs/development.md), independent tests |
| Protocol evidence | [Fixed sources](docs/references/upstream-sync.md), [references](docs/references/README.md) |

Design contracts, source implementation and executed observations are different evidence. Resolve disagreements explicitly; do not rewrite a contract to excuse a bug. Realtime and other deferred designs are not prerequisites for the current request-based scope.

## Current Provider, Model and Compatibility Information

Query current facts; do not maintain Provider/model inventories, support matrices, account status or test results in docs, comments or memory.

1. **Registration:** [provider](src/provider/catalog.rs) and [topology](src/topology/catalog.rs) catalogs; follow Public Model → Route → Endpoint, upstream ID, representation and execution contracts. A Provider or Dialect declaration is not a usable binding.
2. **Activation:** [bootstrap](src/gateway/bootstrap.rs) and [configuration](src/gateway/config.rs); check explicit entries, protocol and credential activation. Chat admission does not imply Responses admission.
3. **Wire:** [adapters](src/adapter/mod.rs), [named rules](src/protocol/adaptation.rs), owning codecs/lowering and independent expectations. Test names/counts do not establish capability.
4. **Probes:** [catalog](examples/probe_support/catalog.py), selected entry points and [operations](docs/probes.md). Probe choices/defaults are not the product catalog.
5. **Instance:** verify binary revision and operator-approved non-secret activation metadata. Read [router](src/gateway/http.rs) before assuming discovery endpoints. Unavailable metadata means unknown activation; never inspect private files or dump environment values. [Official sources](docs/references/providers/README.md) do not prove local admission or inference.

Report revision, scope and unverified layers in the conversation. Credential-bearing discovery and live execution still need bounded authorization.

## Implementation Discipline

### Semantic boundaries

- Maintain one independent Semantic Model for Gateway and future Agent use. IR is its typed representation, not a Provider DTO, protocol field union, common denominator or universal request. Responses is the primary reference; Generation and Embedding remain distinct tasks within the same semantic authority.
- Follow [next-goal](docs/implementation-plans/next-goal.md) for priorities and deferred scope; do not infer a new behavior slice from the broader design. Standard API targets belong to the [Semantic Model](docs/architecture-v2/semantic-ir.md#3-客户端-api-目标与扩展边界). Chat Completions is only a compatibility projection under the [loss contract](docs/architecture-v2/protocol-and-lowering.md#semantic-loss), not permission for arbitrary field dropping, missing IR owners, fabricated facts or unsafe replay. Existing strict behavior remains binding until its implementation slice changes it.
- Distinguish an IR gap, a target-wire gap and missing wiring. Report an IR gap with structural options before choosing an implementation; do not hide it in adapters, fidelity or custom API fields. Do not accept, emit or rebuild an independent `_openbridge` attachment; any future replacement is decided after migration. New client extensions require explicit approval. Do not prebuild deferred protocols or generic frameworks.
- Stabilize concepts, owners and invariants before Rust shapes. Keep task, modality, resource and wire distinct. Pure codecs/lowering cannot access registry, credentials or network; runtime targets/retry/commit state never enter semantic data.
- Final typed values govern encoding. Preserve field-specific presence, order, precision, identity and resource meaning. Edits invalidate dependent replay/annotations; deleted values cannot return through fidelity. Revalidate transformed/projected values and derive requirements anew; each fixed candidate starts from the same immutable input, without capability unions or route reordering.
- Keep response closure, artifact completeness, logical-turn progress and continuation requirements distinct. Representation does not authorize tools, orchestration or automatic continuation. Static/Event and failure behavior must agree.

### Change workflow

- Before behavior changes, record observable result, requirement, failing case, non-goals and verification boundary in current-focus, then use TDD. Clear completed focus without erasing unfinished direction. Documentation-only work does not create a behavior slice.
- Split by responsibility, preserve intended public paths through explicit re-exports, and avoid unrelated cleanup. Large breaking rewrites are allowed within the approved migration scope, without legacy shims or empty schema bumps; update serialization, OpenAPI, examples, fixtures and contracts together. Dependency changes update manifests and locks with locked validation.

## Security and Resources

- Never expose real secrets, private configuration, sensitive bodies or auth caches in files, tools, logs or fixtures. `.env`, private `config/` and OAuth files are not investigation/test inputs. Do not discover third-party auth caches; use synthetic inputs.
- Preserve loopback ingress, trusted egress and fail-closed auth. Business data cannot select upstream origins, credentials, auth/proxy headers or scripts. Credential locators and trusted origins do not go downstream.
- Bound allocation, capture, framing, buffering, events and time. Preserve cancellation/cleanup, real terminals and retry/fallback/publication/commit boundaries; no post-commit replay or fabricated success.
- Content capture requires explicit configuration/authorization, begins after authentication, observes the final downstream boundary and redacts sensitive headers. Bounded snapshots belong only in the dedicated local JSONL sink, not stdout or reviewed OTLP traces. Sink failure cannot change responses; a development logging profile is not sensitive-traffic authorization.
- Tests do not load real credentials, call Providers, implicitly start services or add retry/fallback. Explicit bootstrap tests may own an isolated disposable loopback binary with synthetic keys and rejecting loopback egress. Live/ignored-network/external-dependency gates need approval; paid probes need exact targets, request matrix, budgets and sanitized output limits.
- Do not inspect or manually edit `target/`, `tools/corpus/.venv/`, `.pytest_cache/` or `__pycache__/` without a targeted need. Normal tools may populate caches. Do not commit derived `testdata/{generated,reports,dist,runtime}/`; canonical fixtures are not cleanup targets.

## Verification

- Test distinct semantic, wire and security/resource boundaries at their lowest owner. Pure codec tests do not depend on product catalogs; credential-policy tests do not construct a Gateway. Keep binding/admission integration separate; use at most one production-Router smoke when it adds independent value. Locate independent coverage before removing duplicate assertions.
- Use independent wire→IR and IR→wire expectations, edits, applicable streams and failures; round trips alone can hide symmetric loss. Chat loss tests must assert both permitted loss and protected invariants. Reuse small synthetic fixtures; review external asset version, license, sensitivity and oracle independence.
- Run focused checks, then the required baseline for the changed files in the [development guide](docs/development.md): [Rust](docs/development.md#rust-检查), [JS tooling](docs/development.md#测试语言与-js-工具) or [documentation](docs/development.md#文档与边界). SDK loopback remains a separate explicit gate; prose-only changes do not require runtime tests.
- Parallelize only independent, isolated scenarios. Use readiness/events and bounded deadlines; ordered retry/fallback/cancellation tests remain serial, without sleeps hiding races.
- Inspect final diff and report actual results, failures and skipped layers. Compilation, synthetic execution or test existence do not prove general SDK/Agent, real Provider/TLS/network, cache benefit, load, native filesystem/ACL or production behavior.

## Documentation and Comments

- Follow the [documentation ownership and maintenance rules](docs/README.md#写作与维护); keep one authoritative owner and link to it instead of copying contracts, field tables or commands.
- Rust comments/docs and Python docstrings use concise English; explain non-obvious rationale with essential source URLs.
- Preserve effective constraints, source attribution and incoming links when consolidating. Do not turn cleanup into contract changes or refresh external verification dates without new evidence.
- Keep history, audits and execution results out of docs, comments and memory. Durable memory points to canonical owners and retains only confirmed preferences, relationships and decision context. Documentation changes alone do not prove behavioral improvement.
